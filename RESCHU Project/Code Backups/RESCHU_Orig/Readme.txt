Attached is the RESCHU CD.

The most reliable method to work with the software seems be running it from Eclipse, and it has been tested for 32-bit machines running Windows.  Prior to running the application (Main.app), please go to the "RESCHU_DLLS" folders and follow the brief README.txt file.

We have also included some unofficial documentation of the project and the source code.
